Overview

   [4]Redland  is  a library that provides a high-level interface for the
   Resource  Description  Framework  (RDF)  allowing  the RDF graph to be
   parsed  from  XML, stored, queried and manipulated. Redland implements
   each  of  the  RDF  concepts in its own class via an object based API,
   reflected  into  the language APIs, currently Java, Perl, PHP, Python,
   Ruby  and  Tcl.  Several  classes  providing functionality such as for
   parsers, storage are built as modules that can be loaded at compile or
   run-time as required.

   This  is  a mature and stable RDF library developed since 2000 [5]used
   in multiple projects. See the [6]todo list and the [7]FAQS for general
   information.  A  summary  of  the  changes can be found in the [8]NEWS
   file,  detailed  API  changes in the [9]release notes and file-by-file
   changes in the CVS [10]ChangeLog.

   Redland provides:
     * A modular, [11]object based library written in C
     * [12]Java,  [13]Perl,  [14]PHP,  [15]Python,  [16]Ruby  and [17]Tcl
       interfaces   for  manipulating  the  RDF  [18]graph  and  parts  -
       [19]Statements, [20]Resources and Literals
     * [21]Parsers  and  [22]Serializers  for  reading and writing RDF as
       [23]RDF/XML,   [24]N-Triples   and  [25]Turtle  Terse  RDF  Triple
       Language syntax via the [26]Raptor RDF Parser Toolkit.
     * [27]Storage    for   graphs   in   memory   and   on   disk   with
       Sleepycat/Berkeley  DB,  MySQL  3/4,  [28]AKT Triplestore library,
       files or URIs.
     * Query  APIs  for  the graph by Statement (triples) or by Nodes and
       Arcs
     * Redland  contexts  for  managing  aggregating graphs and recording
       provenance.
     * [29]Statement  Streams for construction, parsing, de/serialisation
       of graphs
     * Start of [30]query language support.
     * No memory leaks.
     * [31]rdfproc RDF processor utility program
