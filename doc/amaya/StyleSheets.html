<h2><a name="L1023">Style Sheets</a></h2>
<p>
The <strong>Style</strong> menu allows you to change the appearance of your
documents by two different means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS),
<li>
using HTML elements and attributes.
</ul>
<p>
The first entries of the <strong>Style</strong> menu are dedicated to CSS, the
last two entries to <a href="#L1371">HTML elements</a>.</p>

<h3>Cascading Style Sheets</h3>

<h4>Creating and updating Style attributes</h4>
<p>
Each of the first four entries of the <strong>Style</strong> menu call a
dialog box that allows you to associate a <code>style</code> attribute with
the currently selected elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Character Style</strong> allows you to choose the font family, the
character style, the body size and the underline style.
<li>
<strong>Colors</strong> allows you to choose the foreground and background
colors from a palette. Click on a palette cell with the left button to set the
foregroud color, click with the middle button to set the backgroud color.
<li>
<strong>Format</strong> allows you to set  alignment, indentation,
justification and linespacing.
<li>
<strong>Background Image</strong> allows you to choose a background image and
its repeat mode.
</ul>
<p>
In all these dialog boxes, <strong>Default</strong> buttons allow you to
remove the corresponding style information from the selected elements.</p>
<p>
All modifications made with these dialog boxes can be viewed immediately in
both the WYSIWYG view and the Structure view.</p>

<h4>Changing width and height of elements</h4>
<p>
The width and height of any element in a document can be changed
interactively, in the same way as <a href="ImageMaps.html#L1171">image map
areas</a>. By pressing the Control key on the keybord and the middle button of
the mouse, you can resize the box associated with the element under the
cursor. When you release the mouse button, the element size is changed and a
<code>style</code> attribute is associated with the element.</p>
<p>
When the resized element is an image, this image is zoomed to fill its new
box.</p>

<h4>Creating, updating and using classes</h4>
<p>
When a <code>style</code> attribute has been associated with an element, you
can use that element as a model for creating or modifying a style rule. Select
this element (you must select only one element and this element must have a
<code>style</code> attribute) and choose <strong>Create Rule</strong> from the
<strong>Style</strong> menu. A dialog box pops up that displays a list of CSS
selectors. This list comprises all classes that are defined for the current
document as well as, the element types to which some style is associated..
Choose a selector in this list or enter a new class name or type name  and
press the <strong>Confirm</strong> button. The style of the selected element
is then associated with the chosen selector and the <code>style</code>
attribute is removed from the selected element. Its content is moved to the
<code>STYLE</code> element, in the document <code>HEAD</code>, and all
elements matching the selector are displayed with the new style.</p>
<p>
When you have created new classes with the <strong>Create Rule</strong>
command, you can associate these classes with some elements in the document
document. Choose <strong>Apply Class</strong> from the <strong>Style</strong>
menu. A dialog box pops up which displays all existing classes. Choose one of
these classes. The selected elements are then displayed with the style
associated with the chosen class.</p>
<p>
To associate a class with an element, you can also use the <a
href="Attributes.html#L1073"><strong>Attributes</strong> menu</a>. This menu
allows you to delete a class attribute from an element or to change it: the
class attribute is handled like any other attribute.</p>

<h3><a name="L1371">Style through HTML elements</a></h3>
<p>
HTML provides some character-level elements that allow you to associate style
with character strings. Two entires from the <strong>Style</strong> menu allow
you to handle these HTML elements.</p>

<h4>Creating HTML style elements</h4>
<p>
Entry <strong>Information type</strong> from the <strong>Style</strong> menu
presents a submenu offering a choice of HTML elements that define abstract
styles. Select first a character string in your page and then choose an item
in this menu. The selected character string receives the corresponding style.
Three of these styles are also available through buttons: <em>emphasis</em>
(button<em> i</em>), <strong>strong</strong> (button <strong>B</strong>) and
<code>code</code> (button <code>TT</code>).</p>
<p>
Entry <strong>Character elements</strong> from the <strong>Style</strong> menu
offers another menu for changing the style of text. The first entries of this
menu could be replaced by CSS and should not be used. They are here only for
the sake of completeness of the HTML 3.2 implementation.</p>

<h4>Removing style</h4>
<p>
To remove style from a character string, select the string first and re-apply
the command that was used for associating the style you want to remove. All
commands in the submenus <strong>Information Type</strong> and
<strong>Character Element</strong> toggle themselves if re-applied.</p>
