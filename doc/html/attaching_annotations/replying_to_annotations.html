<h1>Replying to Annotations / Discussion Threads</h1>

<p>Annotations can be seen as comments to pages. The <strong>Annotation /
Replies</strong> feature enhances the collaborative workspace by allowing
users to reply to annotations or to other replies.</p>

<p>The <strong>Annotations / Reply to annotation</strong> menu command lets
you to create a reply to an existing annotation or to a reply. You can invoke
this command from an open annotation or a reply window. As a result a new
reply window opens. The fields in a reply window can be edited just like in
an annotation window as explained under <strong>Creating an
annotation</strong>.</p>

<p>When the reply is ready, you can post it to a server with
<strong>Annotations / Post to Server</strong> menu command or save it locally
using the <strong>File / Save</strong> menu command. To delete a reply, you
can use the <strong>Annotations / Delete</strong> menu command.</p>

<p>Replies can also be annotated like any other document, as explained in <a
href="creating_an_annotation.html">Creating an annotation</a>.</p>

<h2>The user interface</h2>

<p><img alt="An annotation with a discussion thread"
src="../../images/threads.png" /></p>

<p>In the current user interface, all replies related to an annotation are
shown at the bottom of this annotation, in a thread section. Each item in the
thread gives the date of the reply, the author, and the title of the reply.
The content of any of these replies can be retrieved by double clicking the
replies in the thread. The selected reply will be highlighted and presented
in a reply window. When another selection is made the same reply window is
used.</p>

<h2>Known issues: Incomplete threads</h2>

<p>There is no control yet for controlling which replies should be posted. In
an ideal world, it should not be possible to save a reply to a reply if the
previous reply was not saved in the same server. Likewise, if you delete a
reply, you should delete all replies to this annotation. Not doing leads to
having fragments of threads that cannot be correctly attached in the thread.
For example, let R1 be the reply to annotation A1 and R2 a reply to R1. If
you post R1, and let R2 be stored locally, then when you browse A1 and only
download its local annotations, you will only see R2. At this point, Amaya
does not know that R1 exists, so it assumes that R2 has lost its parent. We
identify these "orphan" threads by putting a question mark symbol
<strong>?</strong> in front of them. If later one, Amaya finds new thread
items, for example, if you download R1, Amaya will then sort the thread view,
inserting the threads as appropriately. In our example, R2 will become a
child of R1, as expected.</p>
