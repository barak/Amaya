<h2 id="Editing">Editing SVG graphics</h2>

<p>Amaya enables you to include vector graphics in Web pages, following the
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) specification.</p>

<p>Amaya handles SVG elements as structured components, in the same way as HTML
elements. Therefore, you can manipulate SVG graphics in the same way you
manipulate other parts of HTML documents.</p>

<p>All editing commands provided by Amaya for handling text are also available
for handling graphics (for example it's possible to create a link on a SVG
element).</p>

<p><strong>Warning: SVG authoring is under development. You may find bugs not
fixed yet and the user interface is likely to change in the future.</strong></p>

<h3>Creating Graphics</h3>

<p>To draw graphics, you need an SVG canvas. This one can either be the whole
document created using the command "File-&gt;New-&gt;New Drawing" or an
<code>&lt;svg/&gt;</code> element inside an XML document. The latter case
happens as soon as you draw graphics: Amaya try and find a place where such an
<code>&lt;svg/&gt;</code> element can be inserted. The element is given default
width and height, but it is possible to resize it.</p>

<p>Once the insert point is inside the SVG canvas you want to draw in, you can
launch a command to create graphics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>connectors: line, simple or double arrow, zigzag.</li>
  <li>text or embedded HTML fragment (<code>foreignObject</code>) and
  image.</li>
  <li>basic shapes: square, rectangle, diamond, parallelogram, trapezium,
    triangles, circle, ellipse.</li>
  <li>polygon, polyline, open and close Bézier curves.</li>
  <li>3D objects: cube, parallelepided, cylinder.</li>
</ul>

<p>In formatted view, the creation of graphics requires direct interaction:</p>
<ul>
  <li>for connectors, basic shapes or 3D objects: you first select the position
    of the left corner by pressing the left mouse button. While holding down
    the button, move the mouse to the position of the opposite corner, then
    release the button.</li>
  <li>for text and foreignObject: click on the position where you want to
    insert the element.</li>
  <li>for polygon and polyline: enter each point by clicking the corresponding
    position with the left mouse button. To add the last point, use a
    double-click. A right click stops the interaction without an additional
    point.</li>
  <li>Bézier curves: same as polygons except that you need to indicate the
    direction of the tangents.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are drawing a line, an arrow, a polygon or a polyline then using the
<kbd>shift</kbd> key allow an approximation of 15°.</p>

<h3>Selecting graphics</h3>

<p>In formatted view, the rules to select graphics are the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the element is empty then you need to click on its edges. Otherwise
    you can click inside it.</li>
  <li>If a polyline or a path is selected, then its control points appear and
    can be selected individually. If the selected control point is part of a
    segment of a Bézier curve, then the corresponding Bézier handle is
    displayed.</li>
  <li>If the <kbd>shift</kbd> key is pressed, then each new element you click
    on is added to the selection.</li>
  <li>Several objects can be selected at the same time, using the the
    rectangular selection tool of the SVG panel.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Applying transformations to graphics</h3>

<p>To apply transformations on one object, you must first select it. The
available transformations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>group/ungroup objects</li>
  <li>changing the level of objects: send to back, one level down, one level
    up, bring to front</li>
  <li>rotate, rotate 90°.</li>
  <li>vertical and horizontal symmetry</li>
  <li>alignments: left, center, right, top, middle, bottom. If only one object
    is selected, the alignment is made according to the SVG canvas.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Styling graphics</h3>

<p>You can change the color of the graphics using the Style panel:</p>
<ul>
  <li>background color is used to fill the graphics.</li>
  <li>text color is used for the stroke color.</li>
</ul>
