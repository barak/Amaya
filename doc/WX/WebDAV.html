<h3>About WebDAV</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV (WWW Distributed Authoring and
Versioning)</a> is a set of extensions to the HTTP protocol, which allows
users to collaboratively edit and manage web resources on remote servers. It
aims to extend the HTTP protocol to give place to an open architecture at
protocol level, to develop new distributed authoring tools in the web,
specially emphasizing the collaborative authoring of web pages (see <a
href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2518.html">RFC 2518</a>). WebDAV
defines operations over properties, collections, namespaces and overwriting
protection (lock mechanism), and for these operations, it defines new
methods, headers, request and response entity bodies. Nevertheless,
versioning features, present in the original proposition, have been moved to
<a href="http://www.webdav.org/">Delta-V</a> IETF work group, which aims to
extend WebDAV and HTTP/1.1 for those features (see E. J. Whitehead's paper
"<a href="http://www.webtechniques.com/  archives/1999/10/whitehead/">The
future of Distributed Software Development on the Internet</a>").</p>

<p>The <strong>lock mechanism</strong> defined in WebDAV has been design to
prevent the resources overwriting (that is, to prevent the lost update
problem) using the operations lock and unlock. A lock controls the write
access to a resource by limiting HTTP writing operations, like PUT, POST and
DELETE. This means that only somebody who knows the lock will be able to
execute those operations. The WebDAV protocol also defines two <strong>lock
scopes</strong>: <em>an</em><em>exclusive and a shared lock</em>. An
exclusive lock guarantees that one person possess the lock, and no one else
will be able to lock the resource (it does not affect the resource reading).
A shared lock give allows to a group of users to create their locks over a
resource, but they must trust each other to prevent access problems. Besides,
each lock has a timeout, but the user cannot forget that locks may disappear
in the server due to exceptions in the server.</p>

<p>We can find more informations about WebDAV in <a
href="http://andrew2.andrew.cmu.edu/rfc/rfc2518.html">RFC 2518</a> and also
at <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV.org</a> website.</p>

<h3>WebDAV Support in Amaya</h3>

<p>Amaya has an optional and limited support for WebDAV. This support include
the following operations: lock/unlock a WebDAV compilant resource, view the
WebDAV properties of a resource and lock discovery capabilities. Besides,
this support includes some awareness functions, that can automatically inform
user about locked resources.</p>

<h3>How Use It?</h3>

<p>The WebDAV support present in Amaya intents to help small groups of users
to edit collaboratively their Web pages. To show you how it works, here is an
example: supose that you have a WebDAV server (indeed, you
<strong>must</strong> have a Web server that supports WebDAV to work with it)
named <code>davserver.mycompany.com</code>, and you and your colleagues want
to edit collaboratively some documents that are in the WebDAV folder
<code>/shared/</code> (WebDAV folders are called collections).</p>

<p>So, imagine that you need change the document
<code>http://davserver.mycompany.com/shared/Doc1.html</code>. To do so, you
will load the document in your Amaya editor, and then you can
<strong>lock</strong> this document (<em>Lock resource</em> entry in <a
href="#L654">Cooperation menu</a> _ see <a href="#L654">Figure 1</a>) . Once
you locked the document, if one of your colleagues try to save some change in
this document, s/he will be warned about your lock, and updates will not be
lost automatically. Thus, while the document is locked, you can savely modify
it, and when you've finished your work, you can <strong>unlock</strong> the
document, allowing you colleague to lock the document and do his/her
modifications.</p>

<p><a id="L654"><img alt="Cooperation Menu"
src="../images/CooperationMenu.gif" /></a></p>

<p>Therefore, if you want to be aware whether a colleague locked a Web page,
you can use the <em>View resource properties</em> entry in <a
href="#L654">Cooperation menu</a> to see all the properties of the page, or
you can configure Amaya to automatically inform you if the page is locked. To
do so, you will need to open the <em>Cooperation-&gt;Preferences</em> dialog,
mark the <em>General Awareness</em> option and put the your shared folder's
reference in the <em>User's WedDAV Resource list</em> field
(<code>http://davserver.mycompany.com/shared/</code>, as shows Figure 2).
Once you did this, when loading a page locked by a colleague under
<code>http://davserver.mycompany.com/shared/</code> folder, you will be
notified by Amaya about this.</p>

<h3>WebDAV options in Amaya registry</h3>

<p>This options are the Cooperation -&gt; Preferences options. Default value
are marked:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><code>DAV_DEPTH= [ infinity | <strong>0</strong> ]</code></dt>
    <dd>Lock depth. If depth is infinity, a lock over a collection (folder)
      will afect all components. Otherwise, the lock will afect just the
      collection, prevent an user that doesn't know the lock to create or
      remove collection's components.</dd>
  <dt><code>DAV_TIMEOUT= [ <strong>Infinite</strong> | Second-XXXX
  ]</code></dt>
    <dd>The desired timeout for the lock. "Infinite" value means that there
      is no timeout value, and "Second-XXXX" will try to get a timeout value
      of XXXX seconds.</dd>
  <dt><code>DAV_LOCK_SCOPE= [ <strong>exclusive</strong> | shared
  ]</code></dt>
    <dd>The lock scope.</dd>
  <dt><code>DAV_USER_URL= [ URL ]</code></dt>
    <dd>An URL that identifies the user. Example: mailto:myself@myhost.com or
      http://myhost.com/myhomepage.html</dd>
  <dt><code>DAV_AWARENESS= [ yes
  |</code><code><strong>no</strong></code><code>]</code></dt>
    <dd>Indicates if the user wants basic awareness information about locked
      resources</dd>
  <dt><code>DAV_AWARENESS_ONEXIT=[ yes
  |</code><em><code></code></em><code><strong>no</strong></code><code>]</code></dt>
    <dd>Indicates if the user wants to receive information about his/her own
      locks, when he/she leaves a resource.</dd>
  <dt><code>DAV_URLS= [ URL URL URL ... ]</code></dt>
    <dd>A list of resource URLs used by the user as WebDAV resources.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>How to compile Amaya with WebDAV functions?</h3>

<p>WebDAV support is an optional feature of Amaya. To compile and use it, you
will need the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Libwww with WebDAV support</li>
  <li>Amaya's configure option</li>
  <li>A WebDAV server to use this functions... <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/Jigsaw/">Jigsaw</a> and <a
    href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> are examples of web servers
    that supports WebDAV.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you made the <em>cvs check-out</em> of <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Library/">Libwww with WebDAV</a> support and get <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/User/cvs.html">Amaya sources</a> , you should
follow this bootstrap instructions (under Linux/Unix environments - for
windows environments, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya</a> and <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Library/">Libwww</a> homepage):</p>

<h4>At libwww folder:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>libtoolize -c -f</li>
  <li>perl config/winConfigure.pl</li>
  <li>aclocal; autoheader; automake; autoconf</li>
</ul>

<h4>At Amaya folder:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>autoconf</li>
  <li>mkdir LINUX-ELF (or GTK, or obj)</li>
  <li>cd LINUX-ELF</li>
  <li>../configure <strong>--with-dav</strong> ... (and all other options
    that you need)</li>
  <li>make</li>
</ul>
