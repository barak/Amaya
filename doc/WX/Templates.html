<h2 id="Templates">Templates in Amaya</h2>

<h3 id="What">What is a template?</h3>

<p>Templates are used to produce multiple documents of the same type. A
template is a skeleton representing a given type of document, expressed in
the format of the final documents to be produced (XHTML, for instance). The
format of the final documents is called the target language and must be an
XML language.</p>

<p>In a template, the skeleton document contains some statements, expressed
in the XTiger (eXtensible Templates for Interactive Guided Editing of
Resources) language, that specify how this minimal document can evolve and
grow, while keeping in line with the intended type of the final document.
Documents produced from this skeleton following the XTiger statements are
called <em>instances</em> of the template. Some parts of the template may be
frozen, if they have to appear in document instances as they are. Some parts
may be changed when producing an instance document, some others may be added
either freely or under some constraints.</p>

<p>The file containing a template must have a <code>.xtd</code> extension.</p>

<p>A template comes often with a set of accompanying resources (images, style
sheets, scripts). A template is a web resource, that can be stored in the
local file system or shared on a remote web server.</p>

<h3 id="Selecting">Selecting templates</h3>

<p>You can create your own templates, using the XTiger language. However, in
the current version of Amaya, no specific support is provided for creating or
updating templates. You can also use the templates available on the Amaya web
site at <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Templates/">http://www.w3.org/Amaya/Templates/</a></p>

<p>You are free to store templates anywhere, in your local file system or
remotely.</p>

<p>To ease selection among your favorite templates, there is a Templates
section in the Preferences dialogue (Edit&gt;Preferences). Use it to register
the templates that Amaya will propose when you create a new document. When
registering a local template, you can call a file browser with the browse
button to locate and select the files to be added to the list. You can also
enter the URI of remote templates in the input area below the list. Use the
buttons on the right side of the list to remove a template or to change the
order of templates in the list.</p>

<p>Registering templates in this list is not mandatory. When you create a new
document instance, you can also choose a template that is not in that
list.</p>

<h3 id="Creating">Creating a document instance</h3>

<p>To create a new document instance from a template, use entry
New&gt;From_template in the File menu. It displays a dialogue box where you
can select:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The directory where the template is located if it is a local file that
    is not registered in the list of templates</li>
  <li>The template itself, either by selecting in the list of registered
    templates or by typing the URI or file name of a template that is not in
    the list</li>
  <li>The URI or file name of the document instance you want to create</li>
  <li>Where to open the new document (Replace current, In new tab, In new
    window)</li>
  <li>The Title of the new document (this is mandatory)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Visualizin">Visualizing template elements</h3>

<p>When a document instance is displayed, Amaya shows the XTiger elements
under the form of colored frames that enclose XHTML elements.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <code>use</code> element is shown as a dashed blue box</li>
  <li>A <code>bag</code> element is shown as a dashed green box</li>
  <li>A <code>repeat</code> element is shown as a dashed purple box</li>
  <li>An <code>option</code> element is shown as a dashed yellow box</li>
  <li>The <code>attribute</code> element is not displayed in the main view,
    as it only impacts the Attributes menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>The XTiger elements can also be seen in the structure view. Open this view
with the Show_structure entry of the View menu. In the structure view, XTiger
elements are displayed in green, while the XHTML elements are in blue. XTiger
elements are also shown in the Source view, but with no special color.</p>

<p>Another way to understand the nesting of XTiger elements with XHTML
elements is the selection path displayed at the bottom of the document
window. There, you can see the list of all elements in the structure of the
document from the root element to the current selection. It is updated every
time the selection is changed. In this path, XTiger elements are displayed in
green and XHTML elements in black. For XTiger elements, it is not the name of
the element that is displayed there (use, bag, repeat, option) but the label
of these elements, as declared in the template.</p>

<h3 id="Editing">Editing a document instance</h3>

<p>Editing is allowed only inside the repeat, option, use, and bag elements,
i.e. within the colored dashed boxes. The rest of the document is the fixed
part of the template and can not be modified.</p>

<h4 id="Editing1">Editing in a <code>repeat</code> element</h4>

<p>In a <code>repeat</code> box (purple), you can create a new instance of
the repeated structure or you can delete one. This is controlled by the
template, which may impose a minimum and/or a maximum number of occurrences
of the repeated structure. When creating new occurrences of the repeated
structure is allowed, click one of the purple '+' icons to create a new
occurrence at that location. You get a pop up menu that tells you what can be
inserted at that position. By clicking in that pop-up menu, you create a new
occurrence of the corresponding type. In some cases the template offers only
one type of occurrence. The pop-up menu then contains a single entry, to
clearly state what will be created. If you click outside the menu, nothing is
created.</p>

<p>Another way to create new occurrences of the repeated structure is to
select an existing occurrence, or to put the caret at the end of an
occurrence, and to press the Return key. A new occurrence of the repeated
structure is then created, provided the maximum number of occurrences is not
reached. The type of the new occurrence is then the same as the one that was
selected when pressing the Return key.</p>

<p>When an existing occurrence is empty or fully selected and the Backspace
or Delete key is pressed, the element is deleted, provided the minimum of
occurrences is not reached.</p>

<h4 id="Editing2">Editing in an <code>option</code> element</h4>

<p><code>option</code> boxes (yellow) display a 'tick' icon in the top left
corner. If the box is empty, clicking this icon creates the optional
structure. If the optional structure is already present, this removes it.</p>

<h4 id="Editing3">Editing in a <code>use</code> element</h4>

<p>Most <code>use</code> elements (blue) allow you just to enter free text or
to freely replace/edit existing text. Other <code>use</code> elements offer a
choice between different types of elements that can be inserted at that
position. In that case, a triangle icon is displayed in the top left corner
of the box. By clicking this icon, you can select one of the allowed types
through a pop-up menu. When you have chosen a type, the corresponding
structure is generated and you can freely edit their content.</p>

<h4 id="Editing4">Editing in a <code>bag</code> element</h4>

<p>In a <code>bag</code> box (green), you insert any number of elements of
the types specified by the template. When you want to insert a XHTML element,
do it the usual way. It may happen that some elements are not allowed by the
template. These elements are greyed out in the menus (in the current version,
this feature is not implemented, but prohibited elements are not created).</p>

<p>Templates introduce new structures (called components) built from XHTML
elements. The "XML element types" panel lists them and allows you to insert
them in bags (green boxes). For inserting a component at the current
position, select its name in the panel and click the Apply button at the
bottom of the panel. You can also double-click its name.</p>
